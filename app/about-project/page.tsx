      <p>Event Ticket Booking UI – Open Source Practice Project 🎟️<br /><br />

Overview <br /><br />

This is a beginner-friendly yet practical Event Ticket Booking UI designed for developers to clone, explore, and build upon. The design focuses on a seamless, login-free ticket reservation flow, allowing users to book event tickets quickly and efficiently.<br />

The project consists of a three-step ticket booking flow, and developers can extend it further by integrating payment solutions, user authentication (optional), and ticket validation systems.<br />

Flow & Features<br /><br />

1️⃣ Ticket Selection<br />
	•	Users can browse available tickets (Free & Paid).<br />
	•	Ticket options are displayed in a list or card view.<br />
	•	For Free Tickets → Clicking “Get Free Ticket” proceeds to attendee details.<br />
	•	For Paid Tickets → Clicking “Purchase Ticket” would ideally open a payment modal.<br /><br />

2️⃣ Attendee Details Form<br />
	•	Users input their Name, Email, and optional Phone Number.<br />
	•	Profile picture upload option with preview functionality.<br />
	•	Ticket summary is visible to ensure users review their details before submission.<br /><br />

3️⃣ Payment or Success Page<br />
	•	If the ticket is free, the user is taken directly to the Ticket Confirmation Page.<br />
	•	If the ticket is paid, developers can integrate Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave to process payments before showing the confirmation page.<br />
	•	Upon successful booking, users should receive:<br />
	•	A visual ticket preview with a unique QR Code.<br />
	•	An option to download the ticket as PDF or save it to their device.<br />
	•	An email confirmation containing ticket details.<br />
How to Build This 🚀<br /><br />

This UI can be implemented using:<br /><br />

📌 Frontend (Next.js or React)<br />
	•	Component Breakdown:<br />
	•	TicketCard.tsx → Displays ticket details<br />
	•	AttendeeForm.tsx → Captures user details<br />
	•	PaymentModal.tsx → Handles payment processing<br />
	•	SuccessScreen.tsx → Shows the final ticket preview<br />
	•	State Management: React’s Context API, Zustand, or Redux (if needed).<br />
	•	File Handling: Users should be able to upload images (profile picture for ticket) using Firebase Storage, Cloudinary, or local preview with URL.createObjectURL().<br /><br />

📌 Backend (Optional)<br />
	•	If persistence is required, a backend can be built using:
	•	Node.js & Express or Firebase Functions<br />
	•	Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase Firestore to store ticket records<br /><br />

📌 Payment Integration<br />
	•	For paid events, developers should integrate:<br />
	•	Stripe Checkout (for international transactions)<br />
	•	Paystack or Flutterwave (for African users)<br /><br />
What You’ll Learn 🧑‍💻<br />
	•	File handling & validation (profile picture uploads).<br />
	•	Dynamic UI updates based on ticket selection.<br />
	•	Persisting bookings using local state or a backend.<br />
	•	Integrating payment gateways for ticket purchases.<br />
	•	Generating & validating QR Codes for event check-in (Advanced).<br /><br />
